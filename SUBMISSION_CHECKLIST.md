## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Quick Start (For Mentor Review)

1. **Clone the repository** (after being added as collaborator)
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Event_Managment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment** (Optional - server works without MongoDB for basic features)

   # Edit .env if needed
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test the application**
   - Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
