# Security Policy

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

The Event Management System team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **harsh@greenhacker.tech**

If you prefer to encrypt your report, you can use our PGP key: **[INSERT PGP KEY IF AVAILABLE]**

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Status Update**: We will send you regular updates about our progress, at least every 7 days.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 90 days of the initial report.

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Confirm the receipt** of your report within 48 hours
2. **Provide an initial assessment** of the vulnerability within 7 days
3. **Work with you** to understand and resolve the issue
4. **Keep you informed** of our progress throughout the process
5. **Credit you** in our security advisory (if you wish)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Input Validation
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper data type validation
- Check for buffer overflows in data processing

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper session management
- Follow the principle of least privilege

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow GDPR and other privacy regulations

#### Dependencies
