### Hacktoberfest Labels

**Automatic Labels:**
- `hacktoberfest`: Issues suitable for Hacktoberfest (applied to issues)
- `hacktoberfest-accepted`: PR accepted for Hacktoberfest (auto-applied to qualifying PRs)

**Maintainer Labels:**
- `spam`: Spam PR - does NOT count for Hacktoberfest

- `needs-review`: Awaiting maintainer review
- `potential-spam`: Flagged for review by automated checks

**Important Notes:**
- PRs are automatically labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted` if created during October 2025
- Maintainers can manually add `hacktoberfest-accepted` to override other labels
- Spam label uses regex `/\bspam\b/i` - any label containing "spam" counts
- Once a PR has `hacktoberfest-accepted`, it cannot be marked spam via labels alone
